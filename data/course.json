The course is geared towards students (including sophomores) who have a strong interest in a future career in biomedical research. This semester will focus on chemical genetics using _Caenorhabditis elegans_ as a model system. Students will gain experience in research rationale and methods, as well as training in the planning, execution, and communication of experimental biology.\n\n**WARNING NOTICE**\n\nThe experiments described in these materials are potentially hazardous and require a high level of safety training, special facilities and equipment, and supervision by appropriate individuals.
